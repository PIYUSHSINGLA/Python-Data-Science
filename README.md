# Python For Data Science

Python is widely used programming language for Data Science. These files are the easiest way to understand and learn Basics of Python and Basic Libraries which are mandatory for starting with Data Science.

To simplify the learning process these file includes various examples and function codes which will help in laying the foundation for learning DS.

1. Learning Python Basics: 

Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists. It can be used to predict outcomes, automate tasks, streamline processes, and offer business intelligence insights. 

2. Learning Numpy: 

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations.The library offers many handy features performing operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python.

3. Learning Pandas: 

Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. It's based on two main data structures: "Series" (one-dimensional, like a list of items) and "Data Frames" (two-dimensional, like a table with multiple columns). Pandas allows converting data structures to DataFrame objects, handling missing data, and adding/deleting columns from DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data with histogram or plot box. It’s a must-have for data wrangling, manipulation, and visualization.

4. Learning Matplotlib: 

This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects — it  provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. 

5. Learning Seaborn: 

Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and serves as a useful Python machine learning tool for visualizing statistical models – heatmaps and other types of visualizations that summarize data and depict the overall distributions. When using this library, you get to benefit from an extensive gallery of visualizations (including complex ones like time series, joint plots, and violin diagrams).
